# Simple weather evaluator

Too lazy to look outside or make sense of the weather in your head? Use this weather evaluating tool to do the thinking for you.

**Taken from question 15 of the T1A1 Workbook assessment**  
*You have access to two variables: raining (boolean) and temperature (integer). If it’s raining and the temperature is less than 15 degrees, print to the screen “It’s wet and cold”, if it is less than 15 but not raining print “It’s not raining but cold”. If it’s greater than or equal to 15 but not raining print “It’s warm but not raining”, and otherwise tell them “It’s warm and raining”.*
